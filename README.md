## Iteration 1 Questions

- A 1-2 summary or bullet points outlining your plan for check-ins throughout the duration of the project.

    Daily check-in before working, at least 5 minutes when splitting up the work.

- A 2-4 sentence summary of your plan for project organization and workflow. This can include bullet points. If you plan to use a project management tool, please include a link to your project board.

    We have decided to use [Trello](https://trello.com/b/TGOdupoY/futbol-group-project-design-2) to plan out our project. Planning on starting out all together, taking turns driving and navigating to give everybody a chance to type. Once we feel confident to split up, we will Divide and Conquer in pairs and keep open communication throughout. We will reconvene for all pull requests.

- A 2-3 sentence summary describing the different approaches your group discussed for project organization and how you collectively made a decision on which to use.

    We discussed using Trello, it looked easy to use and a simple way to help brainstorm and keep a record of our discussions to refer back to. We also have a transparent Slack thread to keep open communication on any changes we might need to make along the way.

- A 2-3 sentence summary describing your approach to the code design.

    We started off by reviewing the data retrieval and data types to get an idea of how to break out the project. We reviewed the project requirements which have laid out a basic template for potential classes and their corresponding tests.

- Include link to your initial DTR document and the date it was completed. If you do additional DTRs later in the project, you should link the revised versions here as well with the date. New versions should be listed alongside older versions. Do not delete old DTRs.

  - [Initial DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qvUHMH-TmDYZV52rQFRTGKdVMmiMlHHbB59TZ9ysMGg/edit?tab=t.0) - 01/13/25

- Create a section in your README called “Contributors”. List each group member’s name and link to their LinkedIn and Github profiles.
